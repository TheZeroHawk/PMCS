# PMCS
A project fight calculator app associated with planetmado.com for game refs/dungeon masters to to assist conducting player involved combat.  Typically done through a process of chat/discord, and manual math/dice rolls.  The PMCS app attempts to trivialize much of the math and rules a Ref has to conduct to output the result of a combat turn/round.
